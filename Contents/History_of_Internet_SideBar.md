### Vinton Gray Cerf
* Born: June 23, 1943 (age 77)
* Known for:
  * TCP/IP
  * Internet Society
* Cerf studied under Professor Gerald Estrin and worked in Professor Leonard Kleinrock's data packet networking group that connected the first two nodes of the ARPANet, the first node on the Internet, and "contributed to a host-to-host protocol" for the ARPANet. 
At UCLA, Cerf met Bob Kahn, who was working on the ARPANet system architecture. Cerf wrote the first TCP protocol with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine, called Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program (RFC 675), published in December 1974. 

### Robert Elliott Kahn
* Born: December 23, 1938 (age 82)
* Known for:
  * TCP/IP
* 1972, he demonstrated the ARPANET by connecting 20 different computers at the International Computer Communication Conference. He then helped develop the TCP/IP protocols for connecting diverse computer networks.
 
### Leonard Kleinrock
* Born: June 13, 1934 (age 87)
* Played an influential role in the development of the ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet, Kleinrock's best-known and most-significant work is on queuing theory He was  formally contracted with Kleinrock in 1969 to measure the performance of packet switching in the ARPANET.

### Paul Baran
* Born: April 29, 1926
* Known for:
  * Packet Switching
* Was a Polish-American engineer who was a pioneer in the development of computer networks. one of the two independent inventors of packet switching

### Lawrence Gilman Roberts
* Born: December 21, 1937
* Known for:
  * Founding father of the Internet
* Roberts and his team created the ARPANET using packet switching techniques  invented by British computer scientist Donald Davies and American Paul Baran.[5][6] The ARPANET, which was built by the Massachusetts-based company Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), was a predecessor to the modern Internet.
