#### Historic revolution in communication, the internet enables millions of people to communication through their personal computers through internet by chat, email, news, online shopping. Internet was on car with wheel and fire and rushing in a rush. 

* The Internet behind the web, Dr. Vinton (Cerf the co-founders of TCP/IP protocol). Said you can know where the things are and where it is located so when you have your hand on top then you can take on the guy like Saddam Hussian. 
* Dr Robert Kahn (Cerf the co-founders of TCP/IP protocol), “Things that matters most have no one in charge”
* Internet has disadvantages also like viral information link during crisis it carried uncensored news on state newspapers, radio, television.
* 1950 origin of Internet, No invention in the history grows and touched the human life so quickly. It gives instant access to things happen everywhere and anywhere.

1950, J.C.R Li clines(Prof of MIT), seminal idea behind the internet has vision that computer can connect to the other computer together so they might be more useful in sharing info among people.

 Dr. Leonard Kleinrock a MIT graduate student applied queueing theory for data transmission. The idea was like letters and post office. The letter would arrive stay at the office and leave. DEMAND ACCESS i.e. you won’t get a resource till you need it and DISTRIBUTED CONTROL i.e. every switch is connected to multiple switches were two main concepts.
 
1st computer was large as big as room. Oct 1957 Sovereign Union launched “Spoornet” to catch up and surpass sovereign in space technology US president created Burao at defence department called ARPA (Advance research project agency).

Later Dr. Paul Baran an internet Pioneer used hot pot routing and made fishnet network. In 1952 inspired by mice in a maze concept the broke messages into pieces with to and from and then the packets find their own path in the network. This was called packet switching. 

In 1966 Bob Taylor recruited Dr. Lary Robert who lived with Kleinrock and has knowledge about packet switching to build the 1st experimental connection between 2 computers. Larry Robert then created IMP’s (Interface message processor). 

*	Imp’s were used as intermediated between computers so it would make transfer easy. He has requested AT&T and IBM to help fund the project but they rejected the idea. 
*	The idea was to  create 4 IMP’s that would connect 4 different centers at UCLA, SRI, UCSB, UTAH. 
*	BBN a Cambridge Company agreed to help. The 1st was at UCLA and they were responsible to write the code with was done by Dr. Stephen Craker and the IMP became the first ARPANET. 
*	1st IMP arrived on 1st sept 1969 and by end of 1969 all 4 were ready.by 1971 there were 18 interconnected computers. Raymond Tomplins on wrote 2 code to send files and to send file to itself. Combined both and what was created is now called EMAIL.
*	 October 1972 first demonstration was help of the computer network. Till 1972 there were only 25 websites. In 1983 TCP was adopted as a Universal Standard. By 1992 there were 50 web pages. By end of 20th century there were 70 million websites
